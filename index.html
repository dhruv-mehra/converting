		<h3>DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT</h3>
		<div class = "directing">
			<img src="images/BTS/IMG_9175.JPG" alt="Directing">
			<div>
				<p>Raised between two hemispheres with opposing values and expectations, cultural confusion and contradiction has been my always. Never fully fitting into either world, my existence
					has been a constant off-broadway performance of different versions of myself for my different homes. And now that the Aunties are prowling on Instagram and sorority sisters
					are getting henna tattoos, my two worlds collide more than ever.</p>
				<p>Romantic relationships forced this conflict into the open. My identity crisis is hard enough, but to square that and compound it with another person’s makes for a beautiful,
					complicated, hilarious mess.</p>
				<p>Converting explores the dynamics of two people caught between worlds while caught up in each other, in a specifically South Asian American context.</p>
				<p> South Asian representation in western media today is more visible than ever before, but it’s often still composed of one-dimensional characters, written as palatable
					representatives for the mainstream rather than real, complicated, messy, people. Converting is about the confused and complex for the complex and confused. But, I believe with
					specificity comes universality.</p>
